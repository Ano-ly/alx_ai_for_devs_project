# üîñ Poll Application

## Project Title & Description
This project is an interactive web application designed for creating, participating in, and sharing polls. It allows users to create custom polls with multiple options, cast their votes, and view real-time results. The application is built for anyone looking for a simple yet effective way to gather opinions or make decisions through voting, from small teams to larger communities. It provides a straightforward and engaging platform for democratic decision-making and opinion gathering.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
The application is built using a robust and modern web development stack:
*   **Framework:** Next.js (React framework for production)
*   **Frontend Library:** React (for building user interfaces)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development)
*   **UI Components:** Shadcn UI (a collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS)
*   **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library (for unit and integration testing)
*   **Language:** TypeScript (for type-safe JavaScript development)

## üß† AI Integration Strategy
Throughout the development of this project, AI tools (such as this IDE agent) are leveraged to enhance productivity, ensure code quality, and streamline various development processes:

*   **Code Generation:**
    *   **Scaffolding Features:** The AI assists in generating boilerplate code for new features, such as creating new pages, API routes (e.g., `/api/polls`, `/api/auth`), and React components (e.g., `PollCard`, `CreatePollForm`).
    *   **Component Generation:** AI can generate functional and presentational components based on descriptions, including their props, state management, and basic JSX structure.
    *   **API Route Generation:** AI helps in defining API endpoints, including request/response schemas and basic handler logic for operations like creating polls, casting votes, and user authentication.

*   **Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** AI is prompted to write unit tests for individual functions and components, ensuring that each part of the codebase works as expected in isolation. This includes tests for utility functions, custom hooks (e.g., `useCopyToClipboard`), and small, focused components.
    *   **Integration Tests:** AI assists in crafting integration tests that verify the interaction between different parts of the application, such as testing the complete poll creation flow, voting process, and user authentication. Prompts include scenarios for successful operations and edge cases.

*   **Documentation:**
    *   **Docstrings and Inline Comments:** AI generates comprehensive docstrings for functions, methods, and components, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. It also adds inline comments for complex logic to improve code readability and maintainability.
    *   **README Maintenance:** The AI is used to generate and update the `README.md` file, ensuring it accurately reflects the project's current state, features, setup instructions, and development guidelines.

*   **Context-Aware Techniques:**
    *   **API Specifications:** When working on API-related tasks, the AI is provided with API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger definitions or custom JSON schemas) to ensure generated code and tests adhere to the defined contracts.
    *   **File Trees and Diffs:** The AI is given access to the project's file tree to understand the overall structure and context. When making changes, code diffs are provided to the AI to help it understand the modifications and generate relevant suggestions, refactorings, or follow-up tasks. This ensures that AI-generated code is consistent with existing patterns and conventions.
